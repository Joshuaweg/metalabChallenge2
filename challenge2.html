-	This webpage looks like the image posted on the challenge board. This process was accomplished
-	by seperataing the image in five separate sections and utilizing element selectors in each section.
-	main sections were separated by using elements h1, h2, h3, and h4. Image sections were constructed
-	using elements p, div, span, and section. the color scheme of each section is based on the properties
-	provided by the ChallengeStyle.css file.-->
